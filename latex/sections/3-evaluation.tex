\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{The Monte-Carlo method}
\label{sec:eval-circle}
The exact value of the unit circle's surface area is
\begin{equation}
    A_{\mathrm{circle,exact}}=\eval{\pi\,r^2}_{r=1}=\pi=3.141\dotso
    \label{eq:circle-area-exact}
\end{equation}
While results of single MC runs may deviate rather noticeably,
plotting the histogram of all MC runs reveals a uniform distribution
centered around the exact value as expected from the central
limit theorem (see \cref{fig:circle-area-hist}).

    deviation \num{3.141(17)}. Notice the corresponding normal

\end{figure}

\subsection{Reweighting}
\label{sec:eval-rew}
One starts with computing the normalized histograms of the resulting spectra,
were the logarithm of the energies is used. The differential candidate number
$\dd{N}/\dd{E}$ can be approximated by dividing the number of particles for a
given bin by its width $\dd{E_i}=10^{\log(E_{i+1})-\log(E_{i})}$, where $E_{i},
E_{i+1}$ are the bin's edges; $\dd{N}/\dd{E}$ is plotted against the central
energies of the bins $\left(10^{\log(E_{i+1})}+10^{\log(E_{i})}\right)/2$ in
loglog-representation. The uncertainties are computed according to Poisson
statistics \cref{eq:mc-std}:
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta{y}=\frac{\dd{N}/\dd{E}}{\sqrt{N}}
\end{equation*}
were $N$ refers to the \emph{unweighted} and \emph{not normalized} number of
candidates per bin.

This is done for the energy spectra with $\alphaflat=-1$ and
$\alphafermi=-2$ and for the reweighted flat spectrum
($\alphaflat\to\alphafermi$, see \cref{eq:reweight}).

    \caption{Normalized histograms and differential energy spectra for
    different spectral indices}
    \label{fig:rew}
\end{figure}

The histogram of the Fermi spectrum (see \cref{fig:rew-fermi}) clearly shows
the predominance of particles at lower energies and an approx.~linear (in
the loglog-representation, slope $\sim-1$) decrease of particle numbers with
increasing energy. This is also reflected in the increasing uncertainties,
which scale as $\Delta{y}\propto1/\sqrt{N}$.
While the spectral curve behaves approx.~as expected from first-order Fermi
acceleration, a deviation is noticeable when looking at the fitted spectral
index.
Also note the \enquote{plateau} at the end of the spectrum, which is due to
insufficient MC statistics in that area.

On the other hand, the flat spectrum (see \cref{fig:rew-flat}) exhibits a
uniform distribution of particle numbers across all energies and therefor
consistently small uncertainties. When applying the weight
$w_{E_0}=E_0^{1-2}=E_0^{-1}$ to this distribution, one obtains a spectrum,
which is in good agreement with the theory, while also maintaining the
well-behaved uncertainties (\cref{fig:rew-rew}).

Due to the absence of any interactions, one would expect the observed spectrum
to be identical to the source spectrum, yet there are deviations in the fitted
spectral index. This is due to statistical effects from the MC simulations;
running these simulations multiple times would probably yield a normal
distribution around the \enquote{true} values. However these statistical
fluctuations are much more significant with the direct simulation (due to the
reasons discussed above), which additionally speaks in favor for the
reweighting.

\emph{Note:} Due to the clear advantages of this technique, all following
simulations will be performed with a flat spectrum and have their results
reweighted to correspond to Fermi-theory.


\subsection{Nuclear Interactions}
The influence of the individual interactions is analysed by looking at the
differential candidate number $\dd{N}/\dd{E}$ times $E^2$. Then, with a
log-scale on the x-axis, a power-law spectrum with $\alpha=-2$ appears as a
horizontal line, which is convenient for identifying and discussing deviations
from the expected curve.
$\dd{N}/\dd{E}$ and the uncertainties are computed as described in
\cref{sec:eval-rew} and $E$ describes the central bin values. The results
are depicted in \cref{fig:interactions}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{tikz/interaction-plots}
    \caption{Normalized energy spectra $\dd{N}/\dd{E}\times{E^2}$ vs.~$E$ for
        all cases}
    \label{fig:interactions}
\end{figure}

When looking at the respective plots, there are a few features to recognize:
\begin{description}
    \item[H close]
        All curves are nearly horizontal for $E<\SI{3e20}{\electronvolt}$
        corresponding to an (unchanged) spectral index $\alpha\approx-2$,
        \ie~no significant energy loss took place. Fluctuations are of
        statistical nature.

        At higher energies, \emph{Photo-Pion-Prod.~(CMB)} causes the
        spectrum first to flatten before steeply falling down at
        $E>\SI{1e21}{\electronvolt}$ (with $\alphafalling\approx-2.31$). The CR
        flux is shifted to lower energies.

        The cutoff appears at higher energies than the estimated
        \SI{5e19}{\electronvolt}, which is no surprise here, because of the
        close source distances \SIrange{0}{10}{\mega\parsec}.

    \item[H far]
        The peak of shifted flux due to \emph{Photo-Pion-Prod.~(CMB)} is formed
        more sharply ($\alphafalling\approx-5.58$), with no
        detected candidates beyond some maximum energy. However that maximum
        value lies with $\sim\SI{5e20}{\electronvolt}$ significantly further
        right than expected.

        The curve of \emph{Photo-Pair-Prod.~(CMB)} shows a weaker but
        noticeable decrease of flux without cutoff (with
        $\alphafalling\approx-2.22$). While this behaviour is
        qualitatively expected, the starting point of this effect lies with
        $\sim\SI{2e19}{\electronvolt}$ also about one order of magnitude too
        far right.

    \item[Fe close]
        The cutoff due to \emph{Photo-Pion-Prod.~(CMB)} is also present (with
        $\alphafalling\approx-2.96$) and
        lies about two orders of magnitude further right compared to hydrogen,
        which is a reasonable result, considering the higher number of
        nucleons on which the total energy is distributed. In addition to
        the peak of left-shifted flux immediately before the cutoff,
        another peak in the spectrum seems to emerge in the region
        \SIrange{1e20}{1e22}{\electronvolt}, which might be attributed to
        secondary particles resulting from \emph{Nuclear Decay} after the
        nucleus was converted to an unstable nuclide during
        Photo-Pion-Prod.~(\eg~${\text{p}+\gamma\to\text{n}+\pi^0}$ yielding
        \ce{^{56}Co} with a half-life of around 77 days; see also
        \cref{tab:secondaries}).

        This hypothesis could be supported by the curve of
        \emph{Photo-Disint.~(CMB)}, which exhibits a rather steep spectrum
        at $\sim\SI{5e21}{\electronvolt}$ resulting in a noticeable decrease
        of flux at energies above that value (with
        $\alphafalling\approx-2.89$). Additionally a very prominent peak is
        apparent for lower energies. This flattening of the spectrum
        is probably caused by secondaries and products of nuclear
        decay with left-shifted energies.

    \item[Fe far]
        The aforementioned weak second peak in the curve of
        \emph{Photo-Pion-Prod.~(CMB)} is now present more distinctly
        ($\alphafalling\approx-2.69$), while the first peak disappeared and the
        cutoff remains only in form of non-existent detections beyond some
        maximum energy, with the steep decline having completely disappeared.

        \emph{Photo-Pion-Prod.~(IRB)} also shows a peak at a similar
        location as with the CMB, followed by a slightly steeper spectrum,
        compared to the initial Fermi spectrum ($\alphafalling\approx-2.12$).
        No cutoff is apparent.

        \emph{Photo-Disint.~(CMB)} now exhibits steep descent
        ($\alphafalling\approx-3.40$) with a clear cutoff at
        $\sim\SI{2e21}{\electronvolt}$, meaning all \Fe-nuclei with larger
        energy have disintegrated or decayed into secondaries, causing the
        strong left-shifted peak in the spectrum.

        While \emph{Photo-Disint.~(IRB)} also shows a strong left-shifted
        peak reflecting the production of secondaries, no cutoff is present
        and the spectrum seems to return the initial spectral index after a
        steeper decline with $\alphafalling\approx-2.45$.

        When given sufficient propagation time (with longer distances),
        energy decay due to \emph{Photo-Pair-Prod.~(CMB)} becomes also
        noticeable for nuclei with energies greater than
        $\SI{1e21}{\electronvolt}$, apparent from a decline of the spectrum
        with $\alphafalling\approx-3.63$. Since this process does not change
        the internal structure of the nuclei, no unstable products are produced
        and thus no decay happens. This is reflected by a missing peak of
        left-shifted flux in the spectrum.

\end{description}

In order to quantify the effects of the interaction mechanisms somewhat
more thoroughly and to compare them with each other, one can estimate a
\emph{loss time scale} by looking at the maximum energy loss and multiplying
the square root of the ratio of the corresponding mass and that energy
difference with some scale length:
\begin{equation}
    \tau\sim d_{\mathrm{scale}}\times\sqrt{\frac{m}{E_0-E_{\mathrm{final}}}}.
\end{equation}
This expresses the time during which the candidate experiences the given energy
loss (the shorter the time, the more significant the respective mechanism). In
order to obtain comparable results, for all distance regimes the same
scale length $d_{\mathrm{scale}}=\SI{100}{\mega\parsec}$ was chosen (see
\cref{tab:loss-time}).

    \label{tab:loss-time}
\end{table}

\begin{description}
    \item[Redshift]
        Energy loss due to the cosmological redshift of the source of course
        depends on the source's distance: for both candidate types the loss
        time of the far regime is one order of magnitude smaller than that of
        the close regime, which is reasonable.

        Further, this mechanism is
        independent of the particle's energy, and thus does not change the
        spectral index.

    \item[Pion-Production]
        As a proton with sufficient energy is estimated to loss all of its energy
        after $\sim\SI{30}{\mega\parsec}$, which is of the same order of
        magnitude as the close distance regime, the similar loss times for both
        distance regimes are reasonable.

        Since $\tau\propto\sqrt{m}$, one might expect longer iron time scales,
        however the opposite is the case. This could probably be attributed
        to the higher number of nucleons, which can undergo this process and
        additional nuclear decay of unstable secondaries (see also
        \cref{tab:secondaries}).

        While the IRB interaction is comparable to the CMB interaction in all
        cases, it is more significant for hydrogen on larger distances. This
        might be due to a lower photon density and a therewith smaller cross
        section. This is again compensated by iron's higher nucleon number.

    \item[Pair-Production]
        As expected from the smaller fractional energy loss and as already seen
        in \cref{fig:interactions}, pair production makes itself noticeable not
        until larger distances.

        While comparable on the large distance regime, the shorter time scale
        for iron on the close regime might again be explained by its higher cross
        section.

        While for both candidate types the time scales in interaction with the
        IRB are rather large (and thus less significant), their difference is
        probably also due to the lower photon density and iron's higher cross
        section.

    \item[Photo-Disintegration]
        The infinite time scales for hydrogen show that no energy loss
        occurred, since there is no nucleus which can disintegrate into smaller
        nuclei (as expected from theory; this simulation could have been
        omitted).

        The values for iron are comparable to energy loss due to
        pion-production and thus belong to the more significant processes (as
        already seen in \cref{fig:interactions}). Interaction with IRB takes
        slightly longer on close distances.

\subsection{Magnetic Deflection}
The deflections experienced by the trajectories of CRs due to turbulent
magnetic fields are investigated by discussing the
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\roman*)}]
    \item the differential candidate number per rigidity $\dd{N}/\dd{\rho}$
        times $\rho^2$, with $\rho=\Lamor/l_c$, $\Lamor=E/ZeBc$ and its
        deviation from the initial power-law spectrum with $\alpha=-2$
        (the spectrum is obtained as described in \cref{sec:eval-rew}; see
        \cref{fig:deflection-spectra}),
    \item the distributions of trajectory lengths (see
        \cref{fig:deflection-traj}), and
    \item the distributions of deflection angles between the momentum vectors
        initially at the source and at the point of detection (see
        \cref{fig:deflection-defl}).
\end{enumerate}

But at first, regarding some important numbers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item With $\lmin=\SI{150}{\kilo\parsec}$ and
        $\lmax=\SI{2000}{\kilo\parsec}$ the expected resonant regime is
        \[\lmin/\lmax=0.075<\rho<1\]

    \item Further, with $\lmin$ and $\lmax$ given, \CRPropa~calculates the
        correlation length to $l_c=\SI{.48}{\mega\parsec}$, from which one has
        the radii of the six observer spheres:
        \[\Robserver=\SIlist{24e-3;0.24;0.48;2.4;24;48}{\mega\parsec}\]
        These distances are the minimally possible trajectory lengths,
        corresponding to candidates travelling without deflection from the
        source to the point of detection.

        In the plots, this is represented by the first bins with
        \[\log(\Robserver/\si{\mega\parsec})=
            \numlist{-1.62;-0.62;-0.32;0.38;1.38;1.68}.\]

    \item The physical upper limit for the trajectory lengths is
        $\dAoU=\SI{4231}{\mega\parsec}$, which is the light-travel
        distance corresponding to the age of the universe with
        \SI{13.8e9}{\jahr}. This is enforced by setting a maximum trajectory
        length as a termination condition for the simulation.
        However, due to an index error in the steering script, not the second
        largest, but the largest radius was chosen for its computation,
        resulting in $\dmax=\SI{4800}{\mega\parsec}$, corresponding to a
        light-travel distance of \SI{15.7e9}{\jahr}.

        In the plots, these values are represented by the last bins with
        \[\log(\dAoU/\si{\mega\parsec})=3.63
            \qq{and}\log(\dmax/\si{\mega\parsec})=3.68.\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
    \item[Rigidity Spectra]
        The resulting spectra are plotted in \cref{fig:deflection-spectra}.
        Resonant scattering shows itself as peaks in those spectra,
        \ie~the flux at resonant rigidities is amplified (candidates below the
        peak gain, while those above lose energy), which results in a deviation
        from $\alpha=-2$.

        With increasing radii the resonant regime is shifted to higher
        rigidities.
        This regime seems to be identical for all field strengths at a fixed
        radius. Further, the estimated spectral indices of the falling edges of
        the resonant peaks at a given radius are very similar (see
        \cref{tab:defl}; the exception being $\Brms=\SI{1}{\nano\gauss}$ and
        $\SI{10}{\nano\gauss}$ at $\Robserver=\SI{24e-3}{\mega\parsec}$, which
        is due to those curves not yet falling into the resonant interval).

        Since $\rho\propto1/\Brms$, the curves for smaller field strengths are
        relatively shifted to higher rigidities according to their respective
        scale factor.
        Because of this shift the curves of smaller field strengths fall into
        the resonant regime later, thus exhibiting less scattering in the
        investigated interval, while having the same energy.

    \item[Trajectory Lengths]
        The distributions of trajectory lengths observed at the six observer
        spheres are plotted in \cref{fig:deflection-traj}.
        Their physical limitations and how they are represented in the plots is
        discussed above.

        For small radii, the first bins (\ie~undeflected candidates) dominate
        the distributions. For $\Brms\ge\SI{10}{\nano\gauss}$ a small irregular
        peak is found at longer trajectories (the irregularities being due to
        statistics, because only a few particles are scattered at this point).
        With increasing radii, this peak broadens, grows more regular (as more
        particles are scattered) and its maximum shifts to the right. The
        initial peak at the first bin decreases in height and the local minimum
        between the two peaks becomes more distinct.

        This development continues with the second peak shifting eventually out
        of the range of possible trajectories and particles accumulating at the
        high end of the spectrum, almost resembling a power law.
        At the farthest radius the initial peak is still recognizable for all
        field strengths, but at different intensities: for
        $\Brms=\SI{50}{\nano\gauss}$ it almost vanishes, while for
        $\Brms=\SI{1}{\nano\gauss}$ it is still stronger than the shifted peak.
        Additionally, while the rising edge of the shifted peak is rather
        regular for $\Brms\ge\SI{10}{\nano\gauss}$, for
        $\Brms=\SI{10}{\nano\gauss}$ statistical irregularities remain
        recognizable.

        \emph{Note:} Since candidates are not removed upon detection, they can
        be detected multiple times by the same sphere and contribute with
        larger trajectories in the resonant case.

    \item[Deflection Angles]
        The distributions of deflection angles observed at the six observer
        spheres are plotted in \cref{fig:deflection-defl}. A range from
        $\ablenkung=\SI{0}{\degree}$ (no deflection) to
        $\ablenkung=\SI{180}{\degree}$ (candidate completely inverses direction
        of travel) is covered.

        The development for increasing radii is similar as above: at first one
        has a strong peak in the first bins (\ie~minimal deflection) with a
        smaller irregular peak for $\Brms\ge\SI{10}{\nano\gauss}$. This peaks
        shifts to the right, grows broader and more regular, eventually forming
        a half-circle (in semilog-representation) centered around
        \SI{90}{\degree}.
        For larger field strengths the initial peak sooner or later disappears,
        while it remains noticeable for $\Brms=\SI{1}{\nano\gauss}$.
\end{description}

When comparing these observations, there are a few things to note:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The development of the angular and trajectory length distributions
        for increasing radii is reflected by the averages those distributions
        (listed in \cref{tab:defl}).

        The averages of the trajectory lengths quickly grow (approx.~like a
        power law), while those for different field strengths at a fixed radius
        lie within the same order of magnitude (the exception being
        $\Brms=\SI{1}{\nano\gauss}$ at some instances).

        For the deflection angles the averages converge to \SI{90}{\degree},
        with $\Brms=\SI{1}{\nano\gauss}$ lagging behind due to the remaining
        initial peak.

    \item The large standard deviations of the distributions reflect on their
        spread-out character with sometimes multiple peaks. For the trajectory
        lengths at $\Robserver<\SI{24}{\mega\parsec}$ and for the deflection
        angles at $\Robserver<\SI{2.4}{\mega\parsec}$ the standard deviations
        are distinctly larger than the averages (in the first case even by an
        order of magnitude!) and therefore are not suitable to construct a
        confidence interval in order to describe the distribution: this would
        result in non-physical results (\ie~$\traj<0$).

    \item Some resemblance between the developments of all three quantities
        (rigidity spectra, trajectory lengths and deflection angles) can be
        identified:

        At small radii, the scattering due to $\Brms=\SI{50}{\nano\gauss}$
        clearly dominates, but the difference with the other cases
        $\Brms\ge\SI{10}{\nano\gauss}$ quickly becomes less significant as they
        grow highly similar to each other (except for the initial peak in the
        trajectory length distribution and a small segment at the higher end in
        the rigidity spectrum).

        The interesting case here is $\Brms=\SI{1}{\nano\gauss}$, whose
        spectrum remains undisturbed for $\rho>\num{5e1}$
        (\ie~$E>\SI{2.2e19}{\eV}$). This un-scattered flux causes the peaks of
        the initial bins in the other two distributions. These parameters
        could provide and approach to explain the observed anisotropy in the
        arrival directions at those high energies.

\subsection{Constraints on the Sources}
\todo{different way to compute $\ablenkung$, due to implementation (only
leaving candidates are detected), the distribution is centered around 45°}

evaluation procedure:

inverse simulation, result obtained at earth by reweighting (observer size:
milky way) -> flux $\CRFlux=r^2\dd{N}/\dd{A}^2\dd{t}$

expected behaviour:
$\CRFlux(\SI{5}{\exa\eV}\le{E}\le\SI{30}{\exa\eV})\propto E^{-2.5}$
and high isotropy

plotted spectra $E^{-2.5}\times\CRFlux$ vs.~$E$ and identified possible
(linear) domains.
For energies in those domains, alpha was fitted via ODR, with red.~$\chi^2$
test. This was repeated for a different source distribution (-> reweighting).

The deflections are this time computed from the line of sight and the final
momentum (different to above) -> due to implementation detail only in [0°,
90°].
Deflections were plotted and averaged (independent of source distribution) for
the above mentioned energy interval.

\todo{discuss good candidates and deduce therefrom source constraints}

while \Brms=\SI{1}{\nano\gauss} shows somehow irregular but good isotropy even
for \SI{2.4}{\mega\parsec}, the spectrum is not very satisfying -> longer
distances or stronger \Brms.

CR flux at greater energies does not match the observations (expected: stronger
decline, here: the opposite)

Additional influences\todox{put in discussion}: iron nuclei

what about the GZK-cutoff?
